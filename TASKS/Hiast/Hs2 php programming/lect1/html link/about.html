	<p>The importance of quality education for Socio-economic development of any country and nation cannot be over-emphasized. In addition to character building it provides the human capital necessary for research, innovation, growth, and national development. Moreover, inclusive and uniform access to higher education is also of pivotal importance to lead the country on the path of economic and technological development.

One of the major challenges being faced by the education sector of Pakistan is lack of qualified faculty vis-a-vis demand. Effective utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools provide a practical solution to this issue while maintaining the highest and internationally acceptable education standards.

Virtual University of Pakistan is pioneer in the use of ICTs for imparting the quality education to its students all over the country including the remote areas and Pakistani overseas diaspora. With its highly flexible mode of education, Virtual University enables its students to manage studies at their own convenience and provides opportunities to harness their untapped talents.

Virtual University of Pakistan is playing its due role in promoting education in the country. I hope that the University will continue to ensure best quality in education and research.

I wish this institute success in the years ahead.

Dr. Arif Alvi
President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan/
Chancellor, Virtual University of Pakistan
